// RevokeExternalGrants is the entry point for IAM revoker Cloud Function.
//
// This sample Cloud Function will be triggered when Event Threat Detection
// detects an anomalous IAM grant. Once triggered this function will
// attempt to revoke the external members added to the policy if they contain
// domains considered disallowed. These members must also be in the folder
// specified within main.tf. This configuration allows you to take a
// remediation action only certain specific members and folders. For example,
// maybe you have a folder "development" where users can experiment and a folder
// "production". You may want to restrict and revoke external grants to the
// "production" folder and not restrict activity within "development".
//
// In order for this revoke to be possible the generated service account must have the
// appropriate permissions required. This can be accomplished in a few ways,
// grant the service account permission at the orgainization, folder or
// project level. For more information see README.md.
